## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fayzulloh and I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo. I love programming because it is a fantastic way for me to apply the knowledge I obtain in the various areas of knowledge that I am interested in. For example, I'm currently working on making a retro command-line chat application to apply my new network programming knowledge. In the past, I've made a tool that applies the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve linear diophantine equations, a program that performs statistical analysis (standard deviation, linear regression, etc) on sets of data, and a tool that provides the electron configuration of a given element. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a retro command-line chat application (using TCP and ncurses)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning network programming
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on UW Orbital
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
