## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fayzulloh and I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo. I love programming because it is a fantastic way for me to apply the knowledge I obtain in the various areas of knowledge that I am interested in. For example, I'm currently working on making a command-line interface program that acts as a [matrix arithmetic calculator](google.com). In the past, I've made a tool that applies the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve linear diophantine equations, a program that performs statistical analysis (standard deviation, linear regression, etc) on sets of data, and a tool that provides the electron configuration of a given element.
