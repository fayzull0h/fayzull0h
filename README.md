## Hi there 👋

I'm Fayzulloh and I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo. I love programming because it is a fantastic way for me to apply the knowledge I obtain in the various areas of knowledge that I am interested in. For example, I'm currently working on making a retro command-line chat application to apply my new network programming knowledge. In the past, I've made a tool that applies the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve linear diophantine equations, a program that performs statistical analysis (standard deviation, linear regression, etc) on sets of data, and a tool that provides the electron configuration of a given element. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an ASCII art based game engine written in C++
- 🌱 I’m currently learning network programming (and a bit of graphics programming)
- 👯 I’m looking to work on low-level C/C++ based projects
- 💬 Ask me about anything!
